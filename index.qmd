Chessmate is a self-hosted chess tutor that ingests PGNs, enriches metadata, and surfaces games through a hybrid of structured filters and semantic search. This site curates the living documentation set that guides contributors, operators, and agents.

## Start Here
- [Chessmate for Dummies](CHESSMATE_FOR_DUMMIES.md): end-to-end walk through of ingestion, embedding, and query flows.
- [Implementation Plan](IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md): phased roadmap and milestone status.

## Architecture & Operations
- [Architecture Overview](ARCHITECTURE.md): system goals, component responsibilities, and diagrams.
- [Operations Playbook](OPERATIONS.md): environment bootstrap, monitoring, and runbooks.
- [Troubleshooting](TROUBLESHOOTING.md): smoke tests and common fixes.

## Team Practices
- [Developer Handbook](DEVELOPER.md): onboarding, tooling, and workflows.
- [Collaboration & Quality Guidelines](GUIDELINES.md): communication and coding standards.
- [LLM Prompts](PROMPTS.md): reusable prompt templates for chess analysis.
