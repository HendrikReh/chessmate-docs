This documentation hub tracks the current state of the Chessmate platform:

- **Purpose**: capture architecture decisions, operational runbooks, onboarding guides, and LLM prompt catalogues in one searchable site.
- **Source of truth**: content mirrors the markdown stored under `docs/` in the primary Chessmate repository and is synchronized into this Quarto project.
- **Publishing**: render locally with `quarto preview` or deploy to GitHub Pages following the [Quarto publishing guide](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html).
- **Contributions**: propose edits through pull requests, pairing doc updates with the code changes they describe.

Questions or suggestions? Open an issue in the Chessmate repository so the team can discuss and track follow-up work.
